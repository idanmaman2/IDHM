[{"body":" My setup for apple M1/2 :: M1 , M2 , Pwning , Reversing By: Idan Maman The source of this post is Scribble format (not Markdown) - SO YEY I guess or somethind IDC. So Today I am going to show you my setup . that will include : Emulation Setup Virtualization Linux Windows Terminal Docker Reversing tools PE edit tools Developing Etc Emulation So Emulation in macos in the m series is a nightmare everthing is so slow if we are trying to use any graphicl feature or something like that . this is why I recommend to install a server version or any os without desktop env . Personaly I use Ubuntu server . any kind of modern windows will not be useable !!! only old version like xp or 95 . Setup So firstly you need to Install UTM . UTM is just a gui warpper of qemu - so if you are in kernel pwning just use qemu directly . so after that we can add a machine - Or if we want to directly use qemu - just 1 later on I will show more things about qenu - this is the most basic form . Virtualization For Virtualization I am using VMWare Fusion(12) Personaly I am using Windows 11 and Fedora . Disclaimer: Windows 11 arm is sucks - you can t use a lot of tools becuase you can t run x64 drivers and any type of Remote process memory write didnt work for me in windows arm so a lot of tools like cmder doesn t work as well . Linux Windows Terminal At start I used the default terminal for a while - it is pretty nice but Warp is a major upgrade to that . link to warp : so with warp you have AI chat  , tmux like windows spliting , warp supporting ssh with bash/fish/zsh - that means you can use all warp s features with your remote machine . so it is pretty cool and have a realy nice gui and text complete so try it ! Docker so I can t say much - it works pretty nice , you can emualte x86 containers or use arm it doesn t use the native kernel it is Virtualalized but it still works great . Reversing tools so that is going to be a long section : PE edit tools Developing Etc Site generated by Frog , the fr ozen bl og tool.
